This project explores a generative framework for de novo design of bioactive molecules, guided by pharmacophore similarity to reference compounds and enforced structural diversity. The approach integrates multiple similarity metrics (MAP4, Tanimoto, Euclidean, Cosine) with reinforcement learning, balancing drug-likeness, synthetic accessibility, docking scores, and scaffold novelty.

As a case study, we focus on potential estrogen receptor degraders for breast cancer therapy. Results show that the generated molecules reproduce key pharmacophoric motifs of known actives while maintaining significant structural divergenceâ€”highlighting their potential patentability and clinical relevance.
