This project explores a generative framework for **de novo design of bioactive molecules**, guided by pharmacophore similarity to reference compounds and enforced structural diversity. The approach integrates multiple similarity metrics (MAP4, Tanimoto, Euclidean, Cosine) with reinforcement learning, balancing **drug-likeness, synthetic accessibility, docking scores, and scaffold novelty**.

As a case study, we focus on potential **estrogen receptor degraders** for breast cancer therapy. Results show that the generated molecules reproduce key pharmacophoric motifs of known actives while maintaining significant structural divergenceâ€”highlighting their potential **patentability and clinical relevance**.

The code to run the generative model using pharmacophoric evaluation in reward is in the freedpp folder.
